' Notes:
' - The Persistence Store is modelled as a separate container (file-based JSON) to emphasise durability and independence.
' - The hangman/game.py module should remain free of Flask imports so it can be unit-tested in isolation.
' - The routes orchestrate interactions between Game, Persistence, and Templates.
