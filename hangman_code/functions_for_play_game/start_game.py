    # To create all of these functions:

    # Write a test in test_start_game_selection - check it fails (Click 
    # on the scientific jar logo on the menu on the left to run the test)
    # This test should be for the most the most basic first step of the 
    #function
    # Then write the function code to pass the test. Check the test passes: 
    # Then write the next test the function has to pass - check the test fails
    # Then write the function code to pass the test
    # So on and so forth
